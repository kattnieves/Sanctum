This will mostly be a personal log just mentioning what I have done and progress I have made.
I am glad that I have begun my journey into programming/coding. There will be no coding inviolved in this README file. This is purely words, my words. Almost like a journal or diary.
I have been studying coding each day for almost a month now and I hope this feeling of interest, enlightnment, passion and intrigue never fade.
