This will mostly be a personal log just mentioning what I have done and progress I have made.
I am glad that I have begun my journey into programming/coding. There will be no coding inviolved in this README file. This is purely words, my words. Almost like a journal or diary.
I have been studying coding each day for almost a month now and I hope this feeling of interest, enlightnment, passion and intrigue never fade.

I have created my first Tribute page!
I used Codepen to complete the project from FreeCodeCamp. It was my first attempt at making anything with CSS/HTML.
Although its not "great" I know I've come a long way! Months ago I would not have even known where to start.
I hope to come back to it one day and make changes and make it more aesthetically appealing, more functional and overall solid.

Today I have spent a lot of time making my personal portfolio. It's hard! A part of me thought it'd be simple. I'd easily hurdle the barrier without a second doubt. This project has proven otherwise. I am not discouraged though. Sure, my portfolio isn't anything magnificent... but it's mine. Just a little piece of the endless possibilites ahead. I have a greater respect for the formats and layers of web pages in general now. It's not just about filling in a template, it's about building a product from letters, numbers and symbols. It's beautiful. I will not let this waiver my determination. Practice makes perfect!
