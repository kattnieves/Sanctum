This will mostly be a personal log just mentioning what I have done and progress I have made.
I am glad that I have begun my journey into programming/coding. There will be no coding inviolved in this README file. This is purely words, my words. Almost like a journal or diary.
I have been studying coding each day for almost a month now and I hope this feeling of interest, enlightnment, passion and intrigue never fade.

I have created my first Tribute page!
I used Codepen to complete the project from FreeCodeCamp. It was my first attempt at making anything with CSS/HTML.
Although its not "great" I know I've come a long way! Months ago I would not have even known where to start.
I hope to come back to it one day and make changes and make it more aesthetically appealing, more functional and overall solid.
